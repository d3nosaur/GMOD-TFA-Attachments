1. Find and open the TFA .lua file corresponding to the weapon
2. Search for the term "SWEP.Attachments"
	If it does exist:
		Add this line to the end of the table, replacing X with the next number available
			[X]={header="Grapple",atts={"raid_grapple"},},
		It should look something like this now
			SWEP.Attachments = {
				[1]={header="Modes",atts={"dc17m_sniper","dc17m_emp","dc17m_shotgun","dc17m_rocket","dc17m_grapple","dc17m_bacta"},},
				[2]={header="Mags",atts = {"dc17m_magext","dc17m_magdrum","dc17m_snipermagext"},},
				[3]={header="Holosights",atts = {"dc17m_holosights"},},
				[4]={header="Laser",atts = {"dc17m_laser"},},
				[5]={header="Grapple",atts={"raid_grapple"},},
			}
	If it does not exist:
		Add this line to the file
		SWEP.Attachments = {[1]={header="Grapple",atts={"raid_grapple"},},}
3. Save the file

On server restart, the gun should have a new C Menu attachment for the Raid Hook Grapple
If Raid Hook is not installed on the server, the attachment will not work
